v0.9.0 (2020-10-20)
------
PB: Update to BPAK 0.4 which contains important security fixes and also introduces
a breaking change to the file format. This requires users to update to
punchboot-tools >= 0.2 and bpak >= 0.4

IMX/imx8m: Allow ddr/hdmi blobs to stored externally relative to the source tree

PB: Use the 'pb' prefix on all device-tree nodes that are owned by PB

v0.8.3 (2020-09-03)
------
pbstate: Split in to lib and CLI
pbstate: Built in GPT support instead of depending on blkid library
imx8x: Key revocation is now implemented
imx8x: All paramters controlling image signing are now optional make
parameters

v0.8.2 (2020-09-02)
------
Bugfixes:
	Armv8: Invalidate instruction cache before jump
	pbtools: Partition UUID fix
	board/imx8qxmek: usdhc0 struct should not be const

v0.8.0 (2020-08-31)
------

Enable MMU and data cache

v0.7.7 (2020-06-17)
------

Bugfix: Prefix all filepath's in board make files with $(BOARD) to ensure that
out-of-tree board code works as expected.

v0.7.6 (2020-06-17)
------
Feature/PB: Add support for board SLC callbacks

IMX/USDHC: Expose some of the low level calls for manipulating the extcsd
outside of the usdhc dirver.

Bugfix/PB: Force 'authenticated' to true when command mode authentication is
disabled through Kconfig

Feature/PB: Allow setting CROSS_COMPILE, BOARD and various tools as a environment
variables to support better integration with build systems like yocto and
buildroot.

Feature/IMX8X: Add SECO API

Feature/IMX: Add GPIO driver

Feature/PB: Include SLC information in device tree. This change introduces the
following new items in the device-tree:

        pb,slc = <0>;
        pb,slc-available-keys = <>;
        pb,slc-active-key = <0x00000000>;

pb,slc 					- The current "Security Life Cycle" (SLC)
pb,slc-available-keys 	- Available key ID's (Keys that have not been revoked)
pb,slc-active-key		- Key that was used to authenticate the boot image


v0.7.5 (2020-06-05)
------

Feature/PB: Use arm generic timers instead of platform specific timers
Feature/PB: timestamp feature for debugging boot timing

v0.7.4 (2020-05-28)
------

Feature/PB: Support callbacks early/late boot
Feature/IMX: Support for USB charger detection with the USBDCD block

v0.7.3 (2020-05-27)
------

Bugfix/PB: Remove checked-in __pycache__ directory and add to gitignore

v0.7.2 (2020-05-25)
------

Bugfix/PB: Rollback error bit was not set

v0.7.1 (2020-05-25)
------

Bugfix/PB: A/B rollback event did not update state
Bugfix/IMX6: Correct detection of HAB security state

v0.7.0 (2020-05-16)
------

* Separated the host tools to separate repository 'punchboot-tools'.
https://github.com/jonasblixt/punchboot-tools

* Complete re-write of the protocol to eliminate depenanices for eMMC, GPT
partition format. Punchboot now carries it's own representation of partitions
which intends to be generic enough to support different types of memories,
partition formats and memory configurations.

* Introduction of KConfig for configuration. This replaces almost all
parameters for make

* Rename 'pbconfig' tool to 'pbstate' which more accuratly reflects it's
pourpose

* 'Recovery mode' is renamed to 'Command mode'

* API to extract BPAK headers when they exist. By invoking the punchboot cli
like this 'punchboot part --show' a list of BPAK headers are presented

* Test platform support for EC algs


v0.6.0
------

Starting with v0.6 punchboot uses the new BPAK format, which replaces PBI and
the pbimage tool.
